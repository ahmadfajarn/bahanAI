          ENVIRONMENT AND THE CORPORATE CULTURE


or in the Prophetic traditions. It has Greek and Latin origins and the
word &quot;technology&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;tekhnologia&quot; and
the Latin word &quot;technolo-gia,&quot; which can be broadly translated into &quot;a
systematic approach in doing things&quot; (Saifuddeen, 2003).
         Since the word &quot;technology&quot; does not have its origin in the Arabic
language, it may be rather clear that it could not be found in either the
Quran or the Hadith. However, this fact does not imply that the usage of
the term &quot;technology&quot; is not mentioned in these two important sources
ofreference for the Muslims.
         By looking more deeply into the Quran as well as the Hadith,
many instances can be found whereby the concept of &quot;technology&quot; is
mentioned. These instances may be rather subtle in nature, therefore, a
deeper analysis of the term would prove that the usage of technology is
somehow implied.
         The Quran mentions for example various technologies found to
have been applied throughout human civilisation, such as ship-building,
navigation, metallurgy, construction and information, and communication
technology (ICT).
         The Islamic point of view is different, somehow made to be
rather implicit. The Quran generally states that Allah ( swt) created
man, and the things he produces. In the annal of Noah (pbuh), as
narrated in the holy Quran, Allah (swt) commands him to build the
Ark (Khalid, 2002): &quot;But construct the Ark under Our own eyes and
Our Revelation and plea not with Me regarding those who committed
injustice, they will surely be drowned. And so, he proceeds to make
the Ark&quot; (Hud: 11:37, 38). In this verse the term &quot;technology&quot; is not
explicit stated, nonetheless, from the context, it can be deduced that in
order to build an ark, which could simultaneously withstand a stormy
weather and carry many people and animals without sinking, would
require the appropriate knowledge in shipbuilding by the builder.
Allah (swt) also taught Dawood (pbuh) to manufacture battle
equipment: &quot;It was We Who taught him the making of coats of mail
for your benefit, to guard you from each other's violence: will ye then
be grateful?&quot; (Anbiya', 21 :80)

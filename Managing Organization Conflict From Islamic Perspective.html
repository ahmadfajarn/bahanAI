Managing Organizational Conflict
From Islamic Perspective

Suhaili Sarif **

Abstrak

Konflik merupakan suatu proses di mana dua atau lebih pihak berbeza
dan bertembung dari segi kepentingan dan objektif peribadi. Konflik
merupakan suatu yang tidak dapat dielakkan dalam sesebuah organisasi.
Oleh yang demikian, Islam telah menggariskan beberapa kaedah
bagaimana konflik dalam persekitaran organisasi dapat diselesaikan.
Artikel ini cuba mengupas konsep konflik dalam organisasi dan bagaimana
konflik yang berlaku dapat diselesaikan dengan cara yang baik
berlandaskan Syariat Islam.

Introduction

Conflict may occur anywhere when two or more people interact with each other. It
can either energize an organization or generate war of words and actions. In an
organization interface, conflict plays a prominent role to ensure the organization
operates effectively and efficiently. Too few conflicts will cause employees in a comfort
zone and hinder them from better performance. On the contrary, too many conflicts
will weaken their bonds and unity. Organizational objectives can hardly be achieved
without unity between the employees.

Hence, conflicts should be wisely managed and managers should have a clear
picture and guidelines of how to resolve the existing conflict. It is important because
in most cases managers who face the problem have to act as a peacemaker or
middleman to resolve the conflict particularly between employees under their
supervision.

Conflict Defined

The phenomenon of conflict has drawn much attention from social scientists. The
relevant literatures are virtually endless and propose many different definitions. A
few selected definitions of conflict by several authors are presented as follows:

1. Conflict refers to disagreement, opposition or struggle between two or more
people or group. It results from their incompatible influence and often
accompanies differences in power among parties.’

2. A process in which one party perceives that its interests are being opposed or
negatively affected by another party.”

3. Aprocess in which an effort is purposely made by A to offset the efforts of B
by some form of blocking that will result in frustrating B in attaining his or
her goals or furthering his or her interests.’

4. Any situation in which there are incompatible goals, cognitions, or emotions
within or between individuals or groups and that leads to opposition or
antagonistic interaction.*

In spite of divergent meanings the term has acquired, several common themes
underlie most definitions. Conflict must be perceived by the parties to it. Whether
conflict exists or not is a perception issue. If no one is aware of a conflict, it is
generally agreed that no conflict exists.

Managing Organizational Conflict From Islamic Perspective

Additional commonalities among most conflict definitions are the concepts
of opposition, scarcity and blockage and the assumption that there are two or more
parties whose interests or goals appear to be incompatible. Resources such as money,
prestige, power are not unlimited. Thus their scarcity encourages blocking behavior.
When one party blocks the means to a goal of another, a conflict state exists. °

Perspectives on Organizational Conflict
TheTraditional View®

The early approach to conflict assumed conflict was bad. Conflict was viewed
negatively and it was used synonymously with terms like violence, destruction and
irrationality in order to reinforce its negative connotation. Hence, conflict was to be
avoided.

The traditional view was consistent with the attitudes that prevailed about
group behavior in the 1930s and 1940s. From findings provided by studies like those
done at Hawthorne, it was argued that conflict was dysfunctional outcome resulting
from poor communication, a lack of openness and trust between people, and the failure
of managers to be responsive to the needs and aspirations of their employees. Since
all conflict is to be avoided, we need merely direct our attention to the causes of
conflict and correct these malfunctioning in order to improve group and organizational
performance.

Human Relation View

In contrast to the traditional view, the human relation view argued that conflict was a
natural occurrence in all groups and organizations. Since conflict was inevitable, the
human relations school advocates acceptance of conflict. They rationalized its existence
and there are even times when conflict may benefit a group’s performance. The human
relations view dominated conflict theory from the late 1940s through the mid 1970s.

109

Jurnal Syariah, 12:2 [2004] 107-122

The Interactionist View’

The latest view toward conflict is the interactionist perspective. While the human
relations approach accepted conflict, the interactionist approach encourages conflict
on the grounds that a harmonious, peaceful, tranquil and cooperative is likely to become
static, apathetic and nonresponsive to needs for change and innovation. The major
contribution of the interactionist approach, therefore, is encouraging group leaders to
maintain an ongoing minimal level of conflict in order to keep the group alive, self
critical and creative.

From these perspectives, it is obvious that organization’s perception towards
conflict differs as a matter of time. Nevertheless, one should realize that conflict has
the potential to improve or reduce the performance of groups or organizations.

The Conflict Process

Conflict can be thought of as a process succeeding through four stages; potential
opposition, cognition and personalization, behaviour and outcomes.®

Managing Organizational Conflict From Islamic Perspective

The first stage in the conflict process is the presence of conditions that create
opportunities for conflict to arise. These conditions, which also may be looked at as
causes or sources of conflict, have been compressed into three general categories,
which are communication, structure and personal variables.

The communicative source represents those opposing forces that arise from
semantic difficulties, misunderstandings and “noise” in the communication channel.
Specifically, evidence demonstrates that semantic difficulties arise as a result of
differences in training, selective perception, and inadequate information about others.
The potential for conflict increases when either too little or too much communication
takes place. Further, the channel chosen for communicating can have an influence on
stimulating opposition. The filtering process that occurs as information is passed
between members and the divergence of communications from formal or previously
established channels, offer potential opportunities for conflict to arise.

The term ‘structure’ in this perspective includes variables such as size; degree
of routinization, specialization, and standardization in the task assigned to group
members; heterogeneity of members; leadership style; reward systems; and the degree
of dependence between groups. The larger the group and the more specialized its
activities, the greater the possibility of conflict. There is also some suggestion that a
close style of leadership, that is rigid and constant observation with restrictive control
of the others’ behaviors, increases conflict potential. Too much dependence on
participation may also stimulate conflict because participation encourages the
promotion of differences. Reward systems, too, are found to create conflict when one
member’s gain is at another’s expense. Finally, if a group is dependent on another
group or if interdependence allows one group to gain at another’s expense, conflicting
forces are stimulated.

The most important personal variables, which relate to the cause of conflict,
are individual value systems and individual idiosyncrasies and differences. Certain
personality types — for example individuals who are highly dictatorial, inflexible, and
who demonstrate low esteem — lead to potential conflict. Different in value systems
such as perception towards freedom, enjoyment, honesty, obedience and equality are
also important sources for creating the potential for conflict.’

of the Negotiator’s Frame “, Academy of Management Executive (August 1992), pp.42-
31.

Jurnal Syariah, 12:2 [2004] 107-122

If the conditions mentioned in the first stage generate frustration, then the
potential for disagreement becomes realized in the second stage. The antecedent
conditions can lead to conflict only when one or more of the parties are affected by,
and cognizant of, the conflict. However, just because a conflict is perceived it does
not necessarily mean it is personalized. It is at the level where conflict is felt, when
individuals become emotionally involved, that lead the parties experience anxiety,
tension, frustration, or hostility.

The third stage instigates when a member engages in an action that frustrates
the attainment of another’s goals or prevents the furthering of the other’s interest.
This action must be intended or there must be a known effort to disturb another.
Overt conflict covers a full range of behaviors, from subtle, indirect and highly control
forms of interference to violent, direct, and uncontrolled struggle.

The final stage in the conflict process is the consequences or outcomes of the
interaction between the overt conflict behavior and conflict-handling behaviours. The
outcomes may be functional or dysfunctional. On the one hand, conflict is functional
or constructive when it improves the quality of decisions, encourages interest and
curiosity among group members, stimulates creativity and innovation, provides the
medium through which problems can be aired and tensions released, and fosters an
environment of self-evaluation and change. Several findings suggest that conflict in
the group might be an indication of strength rather than of weakness.°

On the other hand, conflict may be dysfunctional or destructive when it reduces
group effectiveness. Among the more undesirable consequences are a retarding of
communication, reductions in group cohesiveness, and subordination of group goals
to the primacy of infighting among members. At the extreme, conflict can bring group
functioning to a halt and potentially threaten the group’s survival.&quot;

The demarcation between functional and dysfunctional is neither clear nor
precise. No one level of conflict can be adopted as acceptable or unacceptable under
all conditions. The type and level of conflict that creates healthy and positive

involvement in one group may, in other group or in the same group in another time be
highly dysfunctional. 1

Managing Conflict: An Islamic Perspective

As mentioned earlier, conflict has a significant role in organization. Conflict that
consistently recurring-especially caused by misunderstanding between members-will
reduce the organizational performance. However, the conflict remains necessary to
keep the organization alive and functions effectively. The organization that has too
few conflicts may have members that are too complacent. Moderate conflicts need to
be actively generated to stimulate changes and effectiveness. '*

Islam recognizes conflict and disagreement as a natural phenomenon in
organization. History has shown that conflicts and differences in opinion, approaches
and actions are unavoidable.

Allah says:

“ And if your lord had so willed, He could surely have mankind one
ummah nation or community (following one religion only i.e Islam).
But they will not cease to disagree. Except him on whom your lord has
bestowed His mercy (the follower of truth- Islamic Monotheism) and
for that did He create them.”

[Had (11): 118-119]

These verses proved that Allah intentionally create differences among mankind
so that they may think and solve problem in a creative way. However, it does not
mean that human can behave according to their own accord as Islam provides guidelines
and rules to its followers.

In the early Muslim history, several disagreements between companions
arose but were resolved later. Those disagreements are:

1. Distribution of land after the conquest of Iraq&quot;

After Muslim armies successfully conquered Iraq, the responsibility to decide should
and how to divide the conquered land fell on the khalifah ‘Umar al-Khattab. Different
opinions were raised on the issue and Muslims were in conflict with one another. For
instance, the army commanders and senior companions like ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn
‘Awf thought that the land should be divided and distributed.

‘Uthman, ‘Ali and ‘Umar (RA) thought that the land should not be distributed
but left with the original cultivators. A general assembly was called. It included all
Muhajirin, and five representatives each from Aws and Khazraj tribes. The general
assembly discussed the matter for several days. The crisis became prolonged and
complicated. ‘Umar (RA) one day referred to the Quranic verse that concluded with
the words “...those who come after them.” The assembly was convinced when ‘Umar
(RA) said: “How, then, can I distribute it amongst you and leave those who come
afterwards without any share?” Thus, the conflict was resolved by resorting to an
acceptable authority.

2. Succession of khilafah following the death of ‘Uthman RA.”

‘Uthman (RA)’s assassination caused major division among Muslim. One group
demanded that the new Khalifah, ‘Ali ibn Talib (RA) to punish the assassins and
those who favored the conciliatory approach of the Khalifah. Mu ‘awiyah (RA) refused
to accept the leadership of ‘Ali (RA).

‘Ali (RA) sent a letter to Mu‘awiyah (RA) asking him to submit to his
leadership. Mu’awiyah chose to deny the order. The Khalifah sent an army to subdue
him. The two armies faced each other for three months while concerned people on
both side continued to attempt for a settlement. A truce lasted for an additional month
before it broke out into war. There was much bloodshed, but none can claim victory.
The two leaders continued to exhort their followers against the other.

Finally, it was agreed that the appointment of the Khalifah is to be decided by
two referees, Abii Miisa from ‘Ali (RA)’s side and ‘Amr ibn al-‘As from the other
side. After six months of meeting and discussion, the referees agreed that both

Managing Organizational Conflict From Islamic Perspective

contenders should be deposed and then people will be allowed to choose whomever
they wish to elect as Khalifah. After Abii Misa announced the withdrawal of the ‘Ali
and Mu‘awiyah, ‘Amr announced that he accepts ‘Ali’s withdrawal but confirms
Mu‘awiyah’s claim to the Khilafah. The schism widened further.

With no solution in sight, a group of Muslims decided that the struggle would
end only with the assassination of ‘Ali (RA), Mu‘awiyah (RA) and ‘Amr (RA). They
succeeded only in killing ‘Ali (RA), enabling Mu*awiyah to become the undisputed
ruler. From a shortsighted point of view, the conflict was resolved by resorting to
brute force. From a long-term perspective, the apparent resolution eventually led to a
profound schism in the Muslim ummah.

The Concept of Syira, Ta’awun and Nasihah

The concept of syira, ta’awun and nasihah are so prominent in Islamic management
and administration. These concepts has been wide and deeply appreciated and
implemented since the prophet lifetime in managing conflict and making the best
decision.

Sytra is basically a decision making process - consultative decision-making
- that is considered either obligatory or desirable by Islamic scholars. Those scholars
who choose to emphasize the Quranic verse: ““..and consult them in the affairs” [Ali
“Imran (3):159] consider syiira as obligatory, but those scholars who emphasize the
verse wherein “... and who (conduct) their affairs by mutual consultation...” [al-
Syura(42):38] are praised, consider syira as desirable.'® It is clear that syira is not
merely restricted to consultations or mushawarah, in the form of a process or a method
of how management is conducted; but it also constitutes a praiseworthy characteristic
of a believer, who absorbed by such an attribute will be able to achieve completeness
of believe.&quot;

Within the context of avoiding conflict, one must stress the pro-active nature
of syiira, the idea that one has to invite and seek syiira, not simply engage in it because

Administration, Kuala Lumpur : National Institute of Public Administration Malaysia
(INTAN), pp.60-63

115

Jurnal Syariah, 12:2 [2004] 107-122

it is forced by circumstances. If one consults others in a pro-active way, seeking syira
before crisis emerges, different views are brought into focus well before positions
harden. Those consulted parties are likely to be supportive and ready to accommodate
the issue even if things do not follow their way entirely.

Nasihah on the other hand, is an Arabic word that is usually translated to
mean “sincerity” or “sincere advice”, but actually embodies every type of virtue. The
Prophet (saw) has equated the entire religion to giving nasihah This concept can be
traced back to famous hadith of the Prophet saw :

“The religion is nasithah.” The people asked, “To whom?” The

Prophet (saw) replied, “To Allah and to His Book and to His

Messenger and to the leaders of the Muslims and the common folk.”
[Collected by Bukhari and Muslim] '*

From the hadith, it is understood that the Prophet extended the principle of
nasihah to every one from the top to the bottom, from the leaders to the common
folks.

Nasihah in the context of avoiding conflict should also be pro-active in nature.
It requires an active monitoring of actions and prompt evaluative response to them.
Like consultation, giving and receiving advice is also a prophetic tradition. When
parties involved in a conflict resort to sincere advice as a normal mode of inter-
personal and inter-group behaviour, the potential of conflict is minimized. The parties
involved are able to correct one another’s views and action before they become a
source of conflict.

Finally, the concept of 7a ‘awun, literally means cooperation should be practiced
in order to avoid conflict. The Quran advises Muslims to cooperate with one another
towards goodness and piety but not in indulging into sin and transgression. This attitude
of practicing ta ‘awun in a discreet way forces one to become firm with what is goodness
and piety and what is sin and transgression. And this coming to grips with issues in a
pro-active way leads to reduced incidence of conflict that could be dysfunctional.

Managing Organizational Conflict From Islamic Perspective

The Process of Resolving Conflict

As a religion that encourages love and brotherhood, Islam is very concerned about
the way to resolve conflict. The focus is not only in solving the problem but also the
consequences after an agreement is met. The later aspect is important because most
of the time, despite the problem is successfully resolve, the relation between two
conflicting parties is no longer as close as before.

To deal with such circumstances, Islam suppresses its follower to avoid and
resolve any conflict before the crisis deepens. In addition, every Muslim has to practice
the concept of syiira, t’awun and nasihah in their daily life as mentioned before.

Based on the basic guidelines, conflict management can be handled through
the following process:

1. Stating the conflicting view

The nature or content of the conflict must be thoroughly stated. This will establish
what is at stake and how quickly conflict needs to be resolved based on its seriousness.
However, some conflict may be resolved just by stating the parameters of conflict
clearly, because one party or the other may find that it can live with the situation
without trying to change it.

As far as the step is concerned, it is in line with the Quranic advice to prevent
mankind from acting on what they do not know:

“ And pursue not that of which you have no knowledge; for every act
of hearing or of seeing of (feeling in) the heart will be inquired into
(on the Day of Reckoning)”

|al- Isra’ (17): 36]

In the other versus Allah says
“But they have no knowledge, therein, they follow nothing but

conjecture; and conjecture avails nothing against the truth”
[al-Najm (53):22]

117

Jurnal Syariah, 12:2 [2004] 107-122
2. Agreeing that a conflict exist

At this stage, the conflicting parties must focus on the issue and detach it from
personalities. One way to do this is, when possible, let each side to state the other
side’s position as fairly as it can.

3. Learning the difference

The next step in managing conflict is listening and learning the existing differences.
Most of the time the conflicting parties listen with no intention to learn but to respond
when their turn comes. At this stage the spirit of syi@ra and nasihah must be firmly
appreciated. The parties involved should move to a higher level by consulting one
another on how to deal with the problem between them. Through this exercise, they
direct their mutual resources of creativity, experience and wisdom to attack the
problem, not one another.

4. Solving existed conflict

A number of approaches that are widely carried out are as follows :

4.1 Conflict resolution approaches

Kenneth Thomas (1975) has introduced conflict resolution approaches which are
based on two dimensions:
1. How assertive or unassertive each party is in pursuing its own concerns.
2. How cooperative or uncooperative each is in satisfying the concerns of
the other.

The five approaches to conflict resolutions introduced are:
competition (assertive and uncooperative)
collaboration (assertive and cooperative)
avoidance (unassertive and uncooperative)
accommodation (unassertive and cooperative)
compromise (mid range on both dimension)

4.2 Providing an expert opinion®

On many occasions, the individuals or group involved in the conflict do not have
enough knowledge to judge with authority which view is right. In such situation, it is
best to bring an outside expert that will be able to make correct judgment on the issue.
The expert should be able to win the trust of the conflicting parties and should posses

171

119

Jurnal Syariah, 12:2 [2004] 107-122

the necessary professional credibility. He or she shall make a professional judgment
and shall be able to convince both parties. Convincing both parties about the expert's
judgment is instrumental in the settlement of the conflict.

4.3 Negotiation?!

Negotiation is a process of bargaining between the conflicting parties. The negotiation
is very effective when there is a tendency for reconciliation or agreement. It is not
effective when the settlement requires judging in favor of one side. Allah said regarding
marriage conflicts:

“If ye fear a breach between them twain, Appoint two arbiters, one from
his family and the other from hers; if they wish for reconciliation, Allah
will cause their reconciliation: For Allah hath full knowledge, and is

acquainted with all things.
[al-Nisa’ (4) : 35]

The negotiators can view negotiation as win-lose situation or win-win
situation, depending on the nature of the conflict. The win-win situation appears to
be unrealistic. However, there is usually an innovative potential solution that offers
joint benefit to both parties. These solutions are termed as integrative agreements.

4.4 Arbitration?

As the degree of communication between conflicting groups decreases, the need for
arbitration becomes urgent. Delays in arbitration can worsen the conflict. The
arbitration can take various forms. It can be handled by an accepted neutral person or
committee, or an official authority. In all cases, the arbitrators have to show knowledge
of the issue, understanding of the overall interest of the organization, and especially
impartiality and justice. Allah said:

“ Allah doth command you to render back your trusts to those to
whome they are due; and when ye judge between people, that ye

* ibid, pp 171-172
2 ibid, p.172

120

Managing Organizational Conflict From Islamic Perspective

judge with justice: verily how excellent is the teaching which He
giveth you! For Allah is He who heareth and seeth all things”
[al-Nisa’ (4): 58]

Arbitration should involve conflict smoothing by emphasizing the common
interests and de-emphasizing their differences. Allah has ordained Muslims to reconcile
the differences between one another, emphasizing the bonds of brotherhood that exist
among them. Furthermore, because ego and grudge, usually accompany conflicts,
Allah has coupled reconciliation with belief and awareness of Allah.

The use of authoritative command can be very efficient in arbitration.
However, if it is not coupled with justice and a clear explanation of the reasons behind
the authoritative decision, it will only work in the short run. Authoritative command
is needed when conflicts persist and start hurting the organization, or when one party
is determined to be right while the other is at fault. In fact, if one party has transgressed
upon another, Muslims are ordained to firmly stop this transgression. Once this
aggression is stopped, Muslims need to reconciliate the two parties. Allah said:

“but if one transgresses beyond bonds against the other then fight ye
aginst the one that transgresses until it complies with the command of
Allah, and if complies, then make peace between them with justice,
and be fair fo Allah loves those who are fair”

|al-Hujurat (49): 9]

Conclusion

Conflicts are very common in organization. It is due to the differences in objective,
views, interests and so on. The conflicts could occur between two or more competing
parties from single or different departments. Conflict could be functional or
dysfunctional. Functional conflict is necessary to an organization to keep it alive and
functions effectively. On the other hand, too many conflicts could damage the stability
of an organization. The fact that an organization can benefit from the functional conflict
after it is settled demonstrates that the effect of a conflict depends primarily on the
way it is managed. In case a conflict is not well managed, it becomes automatically a
dysfunctional one that hinders the operations of an organization.

121

Jurnal Syariah, 12:2 [2004] 107-122

Islam has shown several concepts regarding how conflict should be managed.
The concepts of syiira, ta’awun and nasihah should be implemented to avoid and
resolve conflict. Using the concept of syira and nasthah as underlying concepts,
there are several approaches to manage the existed conflict. Such approaches among
others are conflict resolution approaches, negotiation, expert opinion and so forth.
By implementing such approaches we hope that every conflict can be successfully
resolved without damaging the stability of the organization.
